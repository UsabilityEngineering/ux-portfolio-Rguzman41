# Having fun with Xbox

## Ricardo Guzman - 10 March 2023

Back in 2015, I got the Xbox One after asking my dad numerous times for it. As a gamer, my goal was to have an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience and since I had the Xbox 360, the console that was before the One, I figured it'd be best to stick with Xbox. I turned on the console and was greeted with a user-interface that at first confused me by the sheer complexity of it. For reference, here's the Xbox One and the user interface at the time.

On the right side of the console is the power button, which is actually a sensor and not a physical button. I remember I kept pushing the button too hard for the first couple of times I pressed it and the console wouldn't turn on. It was **memorable** when I realized I was supposed to lightly tap it, not push it too hard for it to work. Since it was a sensor, hovering your finger just above it could turn the console on. 

One area for improvement could be in making the power button more **error-tolerant** by providing visual and/or auditory feedback when it is pressed incorrectly or not held down long enough, sort of like the red ring of death, which was a hardware failure that affected a huge number of Xbox 360's when the console launched.

For the homepage, I was able to quickly find and access my game library, as well as browse the online store for new games. I also appreciated the ability to customize my homepage by pinning my favorite games and apps for easy access, which Microsoft added months before I got the Xbox One.

I found the Xbox One to be **efficient** in its ability to quickly load games and navigating the menus in the home page, the place you first go to when you start up the console is a good example of this. The interface was **learnable**, as it only took me a few minutes to understand how to navigate in between the tabs.

The user-interface for the Xbox One went through many changes as it looked for ways to suit users needs.
