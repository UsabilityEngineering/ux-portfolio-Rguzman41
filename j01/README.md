# Having fun with Xbox

## Ricardo Guzman - 10 March 2023

Back in 2015, I got the Xbox One after asking my dad numerous times for it. As a gamer, my goal was to have an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience and since I had the Xbox 360, the console that was before the One, I figured it'd be best to stick with Xbox. I turned on the console and was greeted with a user-interface that at first confused me by the sheer comlexity of it. For reference here's the Xbox One and the user interface at the time.

During gameplay, I found the graphics to be stunning and the sound effects added to the overall immersion. The game loaded quickly and there were no noticeable lags or glitches. I was able to achieve a state of flow as I played, completely losing track of time.

On the right side of the console is the power button, which is actually a sensor and not a physical button. I remember I kept pushing the button too hard for the first couple of times I pressed it and the console wouldn't turn on. It was **memorable** when I relaised I was supposed to lightly tap it, not push it too hard for it to work. Since it was a sensor, hovering your finger just above it could turn the console on. 

One area for improvement could be in making the power button more **error-tolerant** by providing visual or auditory feedback when it is pressed incorrectly or not held down long enough.

I found the Xbox One to be **efficient** in its ability to quickly load games and navigating the menus in the home page, the place you got to where you start up the console is a good example of this. The interface was **learnable**, as it only took me a few minutes to understand how to navigate in between the tabs.

Overall, my experience with the Xbox One was satisfying and enjoyable. It met many of the UX goals and provided me with hours of entertainment.
